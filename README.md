**Project Information**
This project was developed including all included assets (except the 3 photos of shoes) from scratch over a duration of 2 Days by me.  This project demonstrates the speed at which I can produce original content and also learn new skills such as the CSS3 / SVG Animation used in this project (no prior experience before starting work on this project).

**known bugs - improvements that would be made if more time were allocated to development**
As this project is demonstrating my ability to use some of the more advanced CSS features and was produced within a limited timeframe of 2 days from scratch for this explicit purpose not all the bugs were ironed out in time.

- Missing Media Queries to manage reformatting the content in window smaller window sizes/mobile.

- Logo SVG has one of the Anchor Tag's Child Elements offset, overlapping the body content slightly.
